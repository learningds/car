## ...Who are trying to choose a new car ...

But there are so many variations on every possible dimension. On top of that there are an infinite combinations of these.... So we developed <b>Find my perfect car!</b> application to make the process a little simpler.


### ...Because in reality you might really care for one or two parameters...
```{r, cache=TRUE}
data(mtcars)
ncars <- nrow(mtcars)

```

We have a hand picked collection of `r ncars` cars for you to pick based on:

> * The power you want - <b>Cylinders(Cyl)</b> and <b>Horsepower (HP)</b>
> * Primary purpose - may be you care about <b>Miles Per Gallon (mpg)</b>
> * Manufacturer - All of us love some cars over other so we provide an option for choosing the <b>brand</b>
